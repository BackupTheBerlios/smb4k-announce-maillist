Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.9.5 released
Message-ID: <200806011756.53717.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

This release fixes a logon issue that was introduced in version 0.9.4: Smb4K 
sent the login and password to the master browser by default when asking for 
the browse list. This could cause at least master browsers running Samba to 
return an empty browse list. This behavior has now been made configurable and 
can be enabled in the configuration dialog under Network | Authentication | 
Master browsers need authentication. It is turned off by default.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed an authentication issue that occurred when the master browser 
  was queried for the workgroup members.
- Added a configuration entry that must be enabled when authentication 
  information needs to be send to the workgroup master browser when 
  querying it for the browse list.

Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.9.6 released
Message-ID: <200806150924.15027.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

During a code review a crash in the network search code and a problem with 
unquoted paths were found and eliminated. In addition, the synchronization 
code was fixed.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed crash when the search item was empty: Pressing RETURN instead
  of activating the search action will not start a search and
  Smb4KScanner::search() now just returns when the search string is
  empty.
- Revised synchronization.
  + Rewrote Smb4KSynchronizer::slotReceivedStdout().
  + Fixed missing total file number in the synchronization dialog.
  + Fixed error message when the cancel button was pressed.
  + Removed obsolete code for old rsync versions.
- Fixed unquoted path in Smb4KCore::open(), so that also paths ending
  with '$' are opened correctly in Konsole.

Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.10.0alpha released
Message-ID: <200806221103.22302.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

We are proud to announce the immediate availability of the alpha release of 
Smb4K 0.10.0, the first version that runs (only) under KDE 4. Although it is 
not adequate for daily use, Smb4K 0.10.0alpha is already quite stable. 
However, there are most certainly still bugs. Thus, we want to encourage our 
users to report any problems to our bug tracker at 
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=769.

Compared to the current stable 0.9 branch many changes have been made and old 
cruft has been eliminated. If you want to have an overview of all 
modifications, please refer to the ChangeLog file within the source tarball.

Since we changed to cmake instead of automake & friends with this version, the 
configuration is now done in a different way. Do as follows to configure and 
compile Smb4K:

1. Extract the source tarball:

   $ tar xvfj smb4k-0.10.0alpha.tar.bz2

2. Create a build directory:

   $ mkdir smb4k_build
   
   At the moment this is not yet mandatory, but strongly adviced.
  
3. Change into the build directory:
      
   $ cd smb4k_build

4. Configure the source:
   
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[prefix] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug . \
     [path_to_source]
      
   Replace [prefix] with the prefix of your KDE installation and
   [path_to_source] with the path to the source code. If you do not want to
   compile Smb4K with debug symbols, replace 'Debug' with 'Release'. KDevelop
   project files can be generated with the additional -GKDevelop3 argument.

5. Now compile and install Smb4K:
      
   $ make && make install

   If you want to be able to remove Smb4K with your package manager later on,
   use checkinstall instead of make install. The package should be present in
   your distribution's repository.

Please note that this alpha version still lacks some features. Especially the 
Konqueror plugin has not been ported and we haven't decided yet if it will be 
in the final version. To help us with the decision, you can participate in a 
survey we set up at 
https://developer.berlios.de/survey/survey.php?group_id=769&survey_id=167.

The source code of this pre-release can be downloaded from 
http://prdownload.berlios.de/smb4k/smb4k-0.10.0alpha.tar.bz2
