Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.9.4 released
Message-ID: <200804271802.27406.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Smb4K 0.9.4 comes with fixes for minor bugs in the scanner, the mounter, the 
network browser, the configuration dialog, and the shares views. Most of the 
work went into revising the password handler: We successfully tracked down 
and finally eliminated the "Smb4K hangs on KDE start-up" issue. Additionally, 
the wallet support won't be disabled completely when the authentication 
fails, but only for the current session.

ChangeLog:
- Smb4KGlobal::timer() is now deprecated.
- The core classes now use QObject::timerEvent() instead of a connection
  to Smb4KGlobal::timer().
- Smb4K will try to launch the wallet manager before it opens the wallet.
  This should prevent it from hanging on start-up (closes #12707).
- If the digital wallet could not be opened, KWallet support won't be
  disabled completely but only for the current session.
- Fixed blocking of tooltips in the network browser.
- Fixed invalid check in the network browser's tool tip code.
- Simplified code in smb4k_cat. Bumped version to 0.8.
- Fixed disabled configuration dialog when another user edited the same
  system file.
- Fixed wrong path when the strings "cifs" or "smbfs" were part of the
  mount point name (closes #13342).
- Fixed unrecognized authentication error when querying the workgroup
  master browser for the workgroup members (closes #12830).
- Fixed flickering of items in the shares views.
- Applied patch by Dirk Mueller that installs the configuration dialog as
  KDE module.

The source code of the new version can be downloaded from our project page at
