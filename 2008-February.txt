Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.9.3 released
Message-ID: <200802240938.27952.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

This version comes with a backport from the current development branch that 
improves the handling of login information. To achieve this, the format of 
the data that is written to the wallet had to be changed and, thus, Smb4K 
0.9.3 is not compatible with earlier versions. The conversion of the old data 
will be done automatically. Apart from that two (un)mount issues and a 
regression in the network browser have been eliminated.

ChangeLog:
- Revised and optimized the code of the password handler. One consequence
  is, that the format of the wallet entries is not compatible with previous
  versions. The old entries will be converted automatically.
- Fixed a regression in the browser, where the list of shares was not deleted
  when an host item was collapsed.
- Fixed an unmount problem that occurred when mount.smbfs is indeed a symlink 
  to or a copy of mount.cifs.
- The mount command now includes the NetBIOS name of the local host, which
  is at least needed when using port 139.
