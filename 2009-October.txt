Message-ID: <200910011906.25898.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Only one day after version 0.10.3 was released, Smb4K 0.10.4 has been made 
available. It fixed a crash in the main window that was introduced in the last 
release due to my carelessness. Sorry for any inconvenience!

ChangeLog:
- Fixed crash in the main window that made Smb4K unusable when no bookmarks
  were defined.

Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K in KDE Playground
Message-ID: <200910310946.52826.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Today I imported Smb4K HEAD to KDE Playground [1]. From now on, development 
will take place there. Our CVS repository at BerliOS will still be used for 
maintenance of the stable branches, though. Many thanks to the KDE sysadmin 
team who helped with the transition.

You can check out the latest development snapshot with anonymous SVN:

$ svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/network/smb4k
