Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K moves to Sourceforge
Message-ID: <2960351.gpe6iDrUPf@dustpuppy>

We were notified that BerliOS will be closed on 31.12.2011. Due to this fact, 
we will move Smb4K over to Sourceforge. The project page already exists and 
will be populated with the project's files within the next days and weeks. If 
you have bookmarked our old project's web site http://smb4k.berlios.de, please 
replace it with http://smb4k.sf.net.

We would like to thank BerliOS for hosting the Smb4K project over the last 
eight years!

For the Smb4K team

Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.10.90 (1.0.0 rc1) released
Message-ID: <36656073.Gqk0APCg6x@erwin>

This is the first of at least two release candidates of Smb4K 1.0.0. In this 
release the handbook saw further improvements. Lock-ups when inaccessible 
shares are checked (usage, owner, group, etc.), were eliminated and mounting 
under FreeBSD finally works again. The mount dialog now accepts Windows-style 
UNC addresses (\\SERVER\SHARE). The acquisition of IP addresses has been 
improved. The ability to search for IP addresses in the search dialog has been 
removed and hosts are no longer displayed in the search dialog. Again, several 
bugs were fixed.
