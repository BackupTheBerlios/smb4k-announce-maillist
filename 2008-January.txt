Subject: [smb4k-announce] Support for Smb4K 0.6.10 and 0.7.5 terminated
Message-ID: <200801061810.39326.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Today the support for Smb4K's legacy versions 0.6.10 and 0.7.5 has officially 
been terminated. All files have been removed from our project's download 
site. They are still available from our FTP site, though.

We want to encourage all users who still use these versions to update to 
either Smb4K 0.8.7 (KDE 3.2 and above) or to Smb4K 0.9.1 (KDE 3.3 and above).

For the Smb4K team

The second maintenance release of the 0.9 branch comes with minor improvements

ChangeLog:
- Added a few "What's this?" help texts to the "Shares" configuration page.
- Updated translations.
- The preview dialog does not show the "." and ".." directories if the user
  chose to see hidden directories.
- The bookmark folder in the system tray widget now has a bookmark folder
  icon.
- Applied patch provided by Carsten Lohrke so that Smb4K's desktop file
  complies with freedesktop.org's specifications.
- Fixed double declaration in Smb4KSystemTray class.
- Removed Smb4KConfigDialogFactory::setConfigObject() function that was not
  used.
- Fixed poor IP address check in Smb4KScanner::searchForHost().
- Fixed saving of default login data when the wallet was closed.
- Updated handbook.
