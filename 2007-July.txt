Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.8.4 released
Message-ID: <200707141918.23296.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

The Smb4K team released version 0.8.4 of the advanced Samba browser for KDE 
today.

Overview: This release mainly features backported bug fixes from CVS HEAD, but 
also provides an updated Turkish and reintroduces the Polish translation. The 
main improvements are that printing on remote printer shares works again and 
that the DCOP-related hanging of Smb4K on (KDE) start-up has been eliminated. 
The list of all changes can be found below.

ChangeLog:
- Reintroduced Polish translation provided by Jerzy Trzeciak.
- Updated Turkish translation and improved smb4k_add.desktop file. Thanks go
  to Serdar Soytetir for providing the patches.
- Fixed missing functionality of the --ignore-existing argument of rsync.
- Fixed 'net rap server domain' command that is incompatible with Samba
  3.0.25 (and later?).
- Fixed Smb4KPasswordHandler::readAuth() that returned a pointer that was
  freed when the function exited.
- Fixed broken Smb4KPrint::print() function.
- Fixed a bug in the preview dialog that led to the hanging of the whole
  application.
- Fixed DCOP-related hanging of Smb4K during KDE startup (closes #11189):
  + Added 'X-DCOP-ServiceType=Unique' entry to smb4k.desktop file.
  + Implemented KUniqueApplication::start() in main.cpp.
- Fixed a potential memory leak in the bookmark editor.
