Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.8.2 released
Message-ID: <200705011000.23471.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

This is the second maintenance release of Smb4K 0.8 that we released today. It 
provides a workaround for a bug that led to shares being remounted with UID=0 
and GID=0 when the CIFS file system was used. Besides, a few cosmetic changes 
and a bug fix were applied to the utility programs. The handbook was updated.

ChangeLog:
- Modified utility programs:
  + Fixed the "No mode was specified" bug in smb4k_mount/smb4k_umount and
    related issues in the other utility programs.
  + Modified the help screens of the utility programs with respect to clarity
    and better readability.
  + Warnings are shown if deprecated arguments are used.
  + Increased all versions by 0.1.
- Worked around a bug where shares where remounted with UID=0 and GID=0 when
  using the CIFS file system.
- Improved the 'Trouble Shooting' section of the handbook and bumped its 
  version to 1.1.2.

Subject: [smb4k-announce] Smb4K 0.8.3 released
Message-ID: <200705021912.34083.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Only hours after Smb4K 0.8.2 was released, it was noticed that the unmount 
command lines had not been adjusted to the new versions of the utility 
programs and that, hence, Smb4K complained everytime a share was unmounted. 
This issue has been fixed in this version.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed command line in Smb4KMounter:unmount() that provoked smb4k_umount 
  to complain about a deprecated argument.
- Applied Turkish translation patch provided by Ismail Donmez.
